# K-Means Machine Learning Algorithm

This project is an exploration into the depths of K-Means algorithm. With a Housing Dataset, I wanted to classify through Medium Income where would be a good location to get a house. K-Means is a great algorithm to classifiy data into clusters.

With K-Means we can solve problems of categorizing data and understand better to what type / feature they should be put on. 
In this case, the dataset had good data to solve such problem. With the scatter plot below I've confirmed that the train and test data indeed is good and with good accuracy.

And at a later stage with a Decision Tree with our test data, the accuracy was 100%, which means that our K-Means model worked properly and is categorizing the data as it should (in this case in various cluster)
